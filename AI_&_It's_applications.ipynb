        "Intelligent Agent: An intelligent agent is an autonomous entity that observes its environment through sensors, processes the observations to make decisions, and takes actions using actuators to achieve specific goals. They are designed to act rationally to achieve their objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Components of Intelligent Agents:\n",
        "1. Perception - Sensors to perceive the environment. This can be anything from a camera captuing visual data to a temperature sensor\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reasoning - The agent processes the perceived information to make decisions.  This involves algorithms and logic to determine the best course of action based on the current state and goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Actions - The agent uses actuators to take actions within the environment. This can include motors for movement, speakers for communication, or digital signals to control other devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of agents:\n",
        "1. Simple reflex agents:\n",
        "- Definition: These agents select actions based solely on the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. They operate on a condition-action rule (if a condition is met, perform an action).\n",
        "- Example: A thermostat that turns on the heater if the temperature drops below a certain threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Model- based Reflex agents:\n",
        "- Definition: These agents maintain an internal state that depends on the percept history and reflects some aspects of the environment that are not immediately observable. They use this model to make better decisions.\n",
        "- Example: A robot vacuum that keeps track of areas it has already cleaned and obstacles it has encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Goal- based agents:\n",
        "- Definition: These agents act to achieve specific goals. They not only consider the current state but also the future states resulting from their actions to reach their goals.\n",
        "- Example: A GPS navigation system that plans a route to a destination, taking into account current traffic conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Utility- based Agents:\n",
        "- Definition: These agents make decisions based on a utility function that measures the desirability of different states. They aim to maximize their overall utility.\n",
        "- Example: A stock trading bot that evaluates the potential profit and risk of various trades to maximize financial return.\n",
